# Winter Wonderland

A fun, interactive piece focused on what do to in Boston during the winter.

## Dependencies

Install with `npm install`.

## Installation

-  Fork and clone this repository.
-  Move into the cloned repository directory and git init.
-  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Structure

-  Dependencies are stored in package.json.

-  Do not configure grunt packages directly in the Gruntfile.js. Instead, store configurations in the grunt directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's generated by the Gruntfile.js based on the filename of the configuration object stored in the grunt directory.

-  Store JavaScript files in assets/scripts. The "manifest" or entry-point is assets/scripts/index.js. In general, only application initialization goes in this file.

-  Store should store styles in assets/styles.

## Run local server

`grunt serve`

## Build for production

-  Ensure you are on your master branch.

-  Begin by creating a new branch called production
>  `git checkout -b production`

- In your .gitignore file, comment out the lines *bundle.js and dependencies.js so git no longer ignores those files e.g., # *bundle.js. Alternatively you can remove those lines altogether.
> This tells Git to no longer ignore those files so Git can track them.

- Next run `grunt build`.

This bundles your code and creates the bundle.js and dependencies.js files that you just un-ignored.

Now `git add <files>` and `git commit` to add and commit these commented out files

Checking to make sure you're on `production` branch and then SFTP this directory to your hosting server.
